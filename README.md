# Mappite 

Welcome to https://mappite.org GitHub repository. Mappite project is Open Source. Code is publicly available under GPL v3 license.

This page will grow with details to help volounteers providing feedback and enhancements. 

To build a local mappite environment (except internal routing) see [Build](./Build.md) 

### Mappite Routing 

Mappite can use OpenRouteService, Mapquest and Graphhopper as routing engines. Register on their project page to get the key to use [001-Keys.js](mappite-js/001-Keys.js).  The public https://mappite.org web site uses also a customized version of Graphhopper (currently for Europe).

The engine to use depends on some criterias - see `computeRoute()` in [100-Routing.js](mappite-js/100-Routing.js). 

### Map Layers

Mappite uses Leaflet to display map tiles (map images) at different zoom levels. 

### Files

Here goes an high level description of files in `src/` directory.

### Todo

A lot goes here, starting from improving code to make easier for others to contribute. Any suggestion is appreciated.
